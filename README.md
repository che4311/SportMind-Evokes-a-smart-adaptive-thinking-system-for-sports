# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Behavior Planning in Autonomous Sports Training Systems

## 📌 Overview

This project introduces a novel framework that integrates **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** into **autonomous sports training systems** to improve athlete behavior modeling, training adaptability, and strategic decision-making. Traditional sports analytics often fall short in capturing the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of real-time sports interactions. Our approach addresses these limitations through a combination of deep learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and strategic planning techniques.

## 🚀 Key Contributions

1. **GAPP-Net (Game-Aware Performance Prediction Network)**  
   A deep neural network that integrates:
   - Player-level statistics  
   - Team-level interactions  
   - Sequential and contextual game data  
   for accurate, adaptive performance prediction and decision-making.

2. **SGI-Framework (Strategic Game Intelligence)**  
   A multi-agent reinforcement learning system designed for:
   - Coordinated agent behavior  
   - Dynamic adaptation to strategy shifts  
   - Real-time performance optimization in simulated training environments.

3. **Hierarchical RL & Meta-Learning for Cross-Sport Transferability**  
   - Encourages policy generalization across multiple sports environments  
   - Enables quick adaptation to new players, tactics, or sport-specific rules.
